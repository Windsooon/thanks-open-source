        I learned programming by myself at my 20s. I don't have any friends know programing since I majoy in  civil engineering. I'm also suck at English, so most of time I just learned from outdated translated docs. And I'm so poor so I feel quite helpless. 

        I love maintainers begin with when I used Github issues as supprot center at that time (don't do that! you should use stackoverflow.com). The maintainers are so kind, so gentle and spent their time to answered my sily questions. See
      </h4> <a href="https://github.com/desandro/masonry/issues/824">fadeIn() breaking appended transition</a><span> and </span><a href="https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/1118">CSRF Failed when POST data using Alamofire</a>
      <h4>Not just to me, to every issues years after years. These excellent programmers spent their spare time to build a project and help people they don't and will never know that really inspire me. I start contribue to django and also join some NGO programing camp to teach newbies. In the end, I just want to say thank to all these open source maintainers. I quote Feynman's words and edit a little bit. <br>
